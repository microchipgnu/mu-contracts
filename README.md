## Contract Examples

This repo contains some contract examples using the new near-sdk-js.

### Proxy 2

Minting proxy contract. Works great with any Mintbase contract.

It transfers the newly minted token to the previous minter, and so on.

### Proxy 3 

Time-based minting proxy contract. Works great with any Mintbase contract.
